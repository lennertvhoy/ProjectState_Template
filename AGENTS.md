# Truth-First Project Operating System

**Purpose:** Stable operating contract for technical projects that use explicit state, evidence, and short active queues.

This repository supports two modes:
- `bootstrap` for discovery and baseline creation
- `operating` for steady-state delivery

## Read Order

Start every session by reading:
1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `STATUS.md`
3. `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`
4. `PROJECT_DNA.yaml`
5. `NEXT_ACTIONS.md`

Read `BACKLOG.md` and `WORKLOG.md` when planning or reviewing history.

## Universal Rules

These rules apply in all modes:
- no fake completeness
- no unverified claims presented as fact
- user-facing behavior requires direct verification
- screenshots or evidence are required for user-visible changes
- active queue stays short
- history belongs in `WORKLOG.md`, not live state files
- structured state must remain machine-checkable
- end each implementation session with a handoff and hygiene check
- `README.md` is the primary user guide for this published template

## Current Mode

This repo currently operates in: `operating`

This template repository itself has already been bootstrapped and is maintained
as an operating project.

Downstream repos created from this template should begin in `bootstrap` mode.

## Bootstrap Mode

### When Bootstrap Mode Applies
Use bootstrap mode when:
- the repo is new
- state files do not yet exist
- project truth is unclear
- the user explicitly asks for initialization or re-baselining

### Bootstrap Goal
Establish a truthful operating baseline for the project, including filled state
files and a real backlog, and only then switch the repo to operating mode.

### Bootstrap Procedure
1. Investigate the host system and runtime
2. Investigate the repo structure and implementation reality
3. Ask the user only the minimum strategic questions needed
4. Use the CTO lane for brainstorming, research, contradiction resolution, architecture framing, and backlog shaping
5. Generate and fill the state and governance files truthfully
6. Mark unknowns honestly
7. Create the initial backlog and next-actions queue
8. Update this file to operating mode only when bootstrap is complete
9. Record bootstrap completion in `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` and `WORKLOG.md`

### Required System Investigation
Inspect and record, when relevant:
- OS, distro, kernel
- shell and terminal environment
- package manager(s)
- language/runtime versions
- container/runtime tooling
- browser/debug tooling
- active ports and services
- git branch, head, and worktree state

### Required Repo Investigation
Inspect and record:
- top-level structure
- app/service boundaries
- main manifests and config files
- likely entrypoints
- test setup
- deployment assumptions
- contradictions between code and docs

### Bootstrap Output Files
Create or initialize:
- `AGENTS.md`
- `STATUS.md`
- `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`
- `PROJECT_DNA.yaml`
- `PROJECT_ADAPTER.yaml`
- `NEXT_ACTIONS.md`
- `BACKLOG.md`
- `WORKLOG.md`
- `docs/EVIDENCE_LOG.md`

Bootstrap is not complete until these files are filled out enough to guide real
implementation and `BACKLOG.md` is more than a placeholder.

### Bootstrap Honesty Rules
If something is not proven, label it as:
- `observed`
- `unknown`
- `reported`
- `assumed`
- `blocked`
- `stale`
- `invalid`

Do not invent architecture or maturity.

## Operating Mode

### Operating Model
The repo now runs in a human-in-the-loop workflow:
- CEO / human provides current state, requirements, priorities, and agent handoffs
- CTO / product-architecture lead reconstructs truth from user-relayed handoffs and pasted context, judges quality, chooses the next best move, and writes the next coding-agent prompt when appropriate
- coding agent implements one coherent step with verification and evidence, then ends with a final handoff for the CTO lane

The CTO role can be handled by ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or another separate AI chat.
Use `prompts/CTO_SESSION_PROMPT.md` as the startup prompt for that chat.
Assume the CTO lane does not have direct repo access unless the human pastes
state, screenshots, or other context into that chat.

Use the CTO lane for all non-trivial work. Non-trivial means any task involving
multiple files, architecture changes, user-facing behavior, integrations,
migrations, state-structure changes, or work likely to take more than one prompt.
Each non-trivial loop should normally start a fresh coding-agent session.
During initial bootstrap, an initial coding-agent session may come first so it
can read the repo contract, detect `bootstrap` mode, and ask the minimum
strategic questions needed before the CTO loop fully takes over.
Bootstrap should remain a joint CTO + coding-agent phase until the repo truth,
architecture, backlog, and active queue are ready for implementation mode.

A valid CTO handoff should define the verified current state, one coherent scope,
required verification, and the exit condition for the implementation step. If
important context is not preserved in repo state files, the CTO prompt must
restate it explicitly for the next coding-agent session.
In operating mode, the scope should usually be a backlog slice or a very small
set of tightly related backlog items.

### CTO Review Standard
Every handoff must be reviewed for:
- contradictions
- overclaims
- missing proof
- brittle logic
- wrong sequencing
- architectural drift
- weak product prioritization

### Coding-Agent Standard
Implementation prompts must:
- require reading `AGENTS.md` first
- anchor on current verified truth
- define one coherent scope
- forbid overclaiming
- require direct verification
- require state and doc updates when truth changes
- require screenshots/evidence for user-facing work
- require the coding agent to ask the user to provide a CTO agent if no CTO lane or CTO handoff exists yet for non-trivial work
- require the coding agent to end with one final handoff message suitable for pasting into the CTO lane
- require the coding agent, when starting in unclear bootstrap mode, to ask the
  minimum strategic questions needed before implementation
- require the coding agent, when the tool supports it and the task benefits, to
  use subagents or parallel workers

## State Files

- `STATUS.md` = short human truth snapshot
- `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` = structured current truth
- `PROJECT_DNA.yaml` = stable architecture contract
- `PROJECT_ADAPTER.yaml` = optional project-specific vocabulary/runtime adapter
- `NEXT_ACTIONS.md` = active queue only
- `BACKLOG.md` = strategic roadmap
- `WORKLOG.md` = append-only history
- `docs/EVIDENCE_LOG.md` = proof ledger

## Handoff Requirements

Every implementation session ends with:
- what changed
- what was directly verified
- what remains partial or risky
- git head
- clean worktree status
- evidence references
- absolute file paths for evidence artifacts when available
- next recommended action
- handoff wording suitable for direct paste into the CTO chat

## Hygiene Rules

- `STATUS.md` <= 120 lines
- `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` <= 900 lines
- `NEXT_ACTIONS.md` active-only
- no roadmap prose in structured state
- no closed history in `STATUS.md`
